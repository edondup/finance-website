# finance-website
A website where users can create an account to manage an imaginary portfolio of stocks.

## Description
This website is a Python web app using the Flask framework that utlizes a SQLite database. I used bootstrap to style the webpage and Jinja to generate tables. When users create account they are given $10,000 to purchase stocks.

### Notes
I originally created this project as part of the Harvard CS50 Introduction to Computer Science course. The webpage originally used an API request to check current prices on IEX. I created a free account on their webiste which no longer appears to work.
